If you want to add new Notebooks to this project, please follow these steps:

Overall goal: create a jupyter notebook that monitors the top 2oo (by market cap) crypto projects using a chain in LangChain.  research the best market indicators for a 3 hour time frame and backtest the indicators and change them to be as profitable as possiable.  If more information is required please prompt for human input.  Make recommendations how to improve the crypto trading process.  Start by solving Problem_002Agent.ipynb

1. **Create a new Notebook**: The name of the notebook should be "master trading" and should include the best ideas in the git repo.

2. **Solve the Problem**: Write markdown and code in the Notebook to solve the challenge. Make sure to add comments that emphasize the relevant topics from the repo

3. Once the Notebook has run and provided a solution, update the Unreleased section of the CHANGELOG. Mention that the solution number has been solved. If applicable, add up to three one-sentence sub-bullets highlighting what lessons learned from the repo are prominent in this solution.

4. **Shut Down the Kernel**: After you're done solving the challenge, shut down the Kernel for the Notebook. This helps to free up resources for other tasks.
